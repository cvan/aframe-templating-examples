# aframe-templating-examples

Examples of using A-Frame alongside popular templating engines.

Since A-Frame is heavy on the markup, templating engines can greatly reduce the
amount of markup we hand-write. In these examples, we will create forests from
through a single prefabricated tree template.

We will demonstrate:

- Handlebars
- Mustache
- Underscore
- React
